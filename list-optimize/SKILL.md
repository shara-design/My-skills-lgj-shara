# List Optimize

Turn a raw scraped lead list into a qualified, deduplicated, personalized list ready for cold email. Four idempotent phases write back to the Turso `leads` table; the copywriting skill then consumes an optional `{personalization}` token in the E1 opener.

## Step 0 — Prerequisites & working directory

This skill is part of the cold-email pack. The scripts assume a project layout (`scripts/db-query.sh` + `scripts/list-optimize/*.sh` + `scripts/campaigns/<name>/`). When installed via `curl ... install.sh?items=list-optimize | bash`, the skill files land at `~/.claude/skills/list-optimize/` — so the natural project root is that directory.

**Working directory:** `cd ~/.claude/skills/list-optimize/` before running any script, OR copy `scripts/` into your own cold-email project root. The simplest path on first install:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/list-optimize/
# Now `bash scripts/list-optimize/<X>.sh` works
```

If you've installed `cold-email-quickstart` and used it to scaffold a project, run the list-optimize scripts from inside that project (the orchestrator creates the right layout).

**Required env vars** (set in `~/.claude/skills/list-optimize/.env`, or in the cold-email project's `.env` if running there):

| Var | Phase | Required? | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TURSO_DB_URL` | all | yes | written by `lead-tracking-db`'s `db-setup.sh` |
| `TURSO_DB_TOKEN` | all | yes | written by `lead-tracking-db`'s `db-setup.sh` |
| `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` | 3 | optional | <https://perplexity.ai/settings/api> (only if Zeus search is down) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | 4 | optional | <https://console.anthropic.com> (only for headless runs; in-session Claude is the default) |

**Tooling:** `bash` 4+, `curl`, `jq`, `python3`. Run `command -v bash curl jq python3` — if anything's missing, install via `brew install <tool>` (macOS) or your distro's package manager. The companion **lead-tracking-db** skill MUST be installed for the V1 schema (it ships `db-setup.sh` + `schema.sql`); this skill ships `migrate-schema.sh` for the V2 column additions.

## Prerequisites

- Turso DB schema migrated: from the skill dir, `bash scripts/list-optimize/migrate-schema.sh` (one-time, idempotent) — adds 9 columns to `leads` for AI qualification + personalization. Run this after `lead-tracking-db`'s `db-setup.sh`.
- `scripts/campaigns/{campaign-name}/strategy.md` exists (output of `cold-email-strategy`) — required for Phase 1 ICP rules and Phase 4 messaging angle.
- Leads already imported into Turso via `scripts/import-leads.sh` (from `lead-tracking-db`) — so `leads` rows exist.
- **Phase 3 (research):** Zeus search at `search.nextwave.io` works out of the box — no API key needed. Optional fallback: `.env` with `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` for runs where Zeus is down. (Older docs may reference Perplexity as the default; the canonical default is now Zeus.)
- **Phase 4 (personalize):** Default is **Claude in-session** — the active Claude Code session writes openers directly (free on Max plan). Fallback: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` for headless runs (uses Sonnet 4.6).

## Phase 0: Phase Picker (interactive, idempotent)

On every run, `run-pipeline.sh` reads `scripts/campaigns/{campaign}/.metadata.json` for a previous selection at `list_optimize.selection`. If absent, it prompts:

```
What do you want list-optimize to run?
  1) Qualify + Personalize  (recommended, full pipeline)
  2) Qualify only           (skip Perplexity research + opener writing — saves ~$0.005/lead)
  3) Personalize only       (skip ICP qualification — assumes leads pre-qualified)
  4) Skip everything
```

The selection is saved back to metadata so re-runs (resume after Ctrl-C, restart after email-verification) never re-prompt. Selection-to-phase mapping:

| Selection | Phase 1 (qualify) | Phase 2 (normalize) | Phase 3 (research) | Phase 4 (personalize) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `both` | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| `qualify_only` | yes | yes | skip | skip |
| `personalize_only` | skip | skip | yes | yes |
| `skip` | skip | skip | skip | skip (no-op exit) |

`personalize_only` keeps the Phase 3 filter `pipeline_status='verified'` — it does NOT bypass the verification gate, only the qualification gate.

To force re-prompt, edit `.metadata.json` and remove the `list_optimize` key (or pass `--reset-picker` to `run-pipeline.sh`).

## Pre-flight: Cold Email Tool Variable Validation

Before any Phase 3 or Phase 4 DB writes, `run-pipeline.sh` calls `scripts/list-optimize/validate-campaign-vars.sh <campaign>` to confirm the target Instantly / Email Bison campaign template can actually consume what we generate. Three checks; all must pass.

**1. Template scan (read-only).** Pull the campaign's E1–E4 sequence text from the API and grep for `{var}` / `{{var}}` tokens. Hard-fail on any token that has no value in our lead payload schema:

| Allowed (Instantly) | Allowed (Email Bison) |
|---|---|
| `{{firstName}}`, `{{lastName}}`, `{{companyName}}`, `{{email}}`, `{{personalization}}` | `{FIRST_NAME}`, `{LAST_NAME}`, `{COMPANY}`, `{EMAIL}`, `{personalization}` |

Any other token = fail with `unknown token '{X}' in step Y`.

**2. Fallback check (read-only).** Every reference to `{personalization}` (Bison) or `{{personalization}}` (Instantly) MUST be wrapped as `{personalization|fallback}` per `cold-email-copywriting/references/copy-constraints.md`. Bare token = hard fail. Citation: copy-constraints.md.

**3. Dry-run roundtrip (real campaign, immediately deleted).** Push one sentinel lead (`hyperlist-test+{epoch}@example.invalid`) with every custom field populated, GET it back, confirm every field round-tripped, then DELETE. Wrapped in a `trap` so failure paths still delete. The `.invalid` TLD is reserved per RFC 2606 — even if the lead were ever sent, it would NXDOMAIN immediately.

Validator exits non-zero on any failure with the offending check + step + token named. Skipped automatically when only `qualify_only` is selected (no personalization variable to check).

## Phase 1: Qualify (AI on every lead)

For every lead with `qualification_status IS NULL`, batch 20 leads at a time to Claude with the campaign's ICP rules. Returns `{status: qualified|disqualified, reason, score}` per lead.

```bash
bash scripts/list-optimize/qualify.sh <campaign-name> [--limit N]
```

What it does:
1. Reads `scripts/campaigns/{campaign}/strategy.md` and extracts the ICP block (job titles, industries, size range, geography, pain points).
2. Pulls leads where `qualification_status IS NULL` (default all, `--limit N` for testing).
3. For each batch of 20, builds a JSON request to Claude that includes the lead rows and the ICP rules + the AI Qualification Prompt from strategy.md.
4. Parses the structured-output response and writes back per-lead:
   - `qualification_status` = `qualified` | `disqualified`
   - `qualification_reason` = LLM rationale
   - `qualification_score` = 0-100
   - `do_not_contact` = `1` if disqualified
5. Appends a `lead_events` row per lead with `event_type='status_changed'`, `source='manual'`, and JSON `event_data` containing `{phase: "list_optimize_qualify", status, reason, score}`.

Idempotent: re-running skips leads already qualified.

See `references/qualification-prompt.md` for the LLM prompt template.

## Phase 2: Normalize Company Name

Canonicalize `company_name` so duplicates merge under one normalized form (e.g., `Acme Inc.`, `Acme, LLC`, `acme inc` -> `Acme`). Pure bash, no API calls.

```bash
bash scripts/list-optimize/normalize-company.sh [--limit N]
```

What it does:
1. Pulls leads where `company_name IS NOT NULL AND company_name_normalized IS NULL`.
2. For each row:
   - Saves the raw value to `company_name_original` (preserve audit trail).
   - Strips suffixes: `Inc`, `Inc.`, `LLC`, `L.L.C.`, `Corp`, `Corporation`, `Ltd`, `Limited`, `Co.`, `Co`, `Pty Ltd`, `GmbH`, `S.A.`, `S.r.l.`, `K.K.`
   - Strips leading `The `
   - Title-cases tokens (preserves all-caps acronyms ≤4 chars: `IBM`, `NASA`, `AT&T`)
   - Collapses whitespace
   - Saves to `company_name_normalized`
3. After the pass, runs a duplicate-detection query and emits a CSV report `scripts/campaigns/{campaign}/company-dupes.csv` listing groups of leads with the same normalized name. **Does not auto-merge** — review-only.

See `references/company-normalization-rules.md` for the full rule set.

## Run email-verification BETWEEN Phase 2 and Phase 3

After phases 1-2, run the existing `email-verification` skill against `WHERE qualification_status = 'qualified'`. This sets `pipeline_status` to `verified` / `bounced` per existing logic. **Phase 3 only runs on verified survivors** to keep Perplexity spend efficient.

## Phase 3: Research (Zeus search default, Perplexity fallback)

For each verified+qualified lead with `personalization_status IS NULL`, hit a citation-grounded web-search API to find a recent newsworthy thing about that person/company.

```bash
bash scripts/list-optimize/research.sh <campaign-name> [--limit N] [--yes]
# Legacy alias: scripts/list-optimize/perplexity-research.sh (still works)
```

**Default backend: Zeus search** (`search.nextwave.io`) — free, no API key required, ~30s/req, citation-grounded. Set `User-Agent: curl/8.0` on every request (urllib default UA hits a 403 from the Cloudflare WAF).

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://search.nextwave.io/api/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "User-Agent: curl/8.0" \
  -d '{
    "chatModel": {"providerId": "a512070c-aecb-4540-af21-fa64c0c03d94", "key": "qwen3-14b"},
    "embeddingModel": {"providerId": "a07fbfdd-1a9b-40f6-b729-92150936de0a", "key": "mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1"},
    "optimizationMode": "balanced",
    "sources": ["web"],
    "query": "Recent newsworthy items from the last 90 days about <first_name> <last_name> (<job_title> at <company_name>): posts, podcast appearances, hires, funding, product launches, or notable company moments.",
    "systemInstructions": "/no_think\n\nFind ONE specific recent newsworthy thing for a cold email opener. Output STRICT JSON only: {\"topic\": \"<short label or null>\", \"source_url\": \"<url or null>\", \"one_sentence_summary\": \"<1 sentence or null>\"}. If nothing notable, return {\"topic\": null}.",
    "stream": false
  }'
```

**Fallback backend: Perplexity sonar** (`api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions`, model `sonar`) — paid at ~$0.005/req. Use when Zeus is down (set `--backend perplexity` or detect 5xx and retry on Perplexity). Requires `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`.

Cost preflight (always runs first):
1. Counts target leads via `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM leads WHERE qualification_status='qualified' AND pipeline_status='verified' AND personalization_status IS NULL`.
2. Backend-aware cost calc: Zeus = $0.00, Perplexity = N × $0.005.
3. Prints `Estimated cost: $X.XX for N leads (backend: zeus|perplexity). Continue? [y/N]`.
4. Aborts on anything other than `y`. `--yes` skips the prompt for headless runs.

**Required quality guards (apply on the response, BEFORE writeback):**

1. **Hallucination guard.** If `len(sources) == 0` in the Zeus response (or `citations: []` in Perplexity), force `topic = null` regardless of what the model said. qwen3-14b confabulates plausible-sounding fake news when web search returns zero hits. Without this guard ~15-25% of "researched" results are fabricated.
2. **Company-name match filter.** After parsing the JSON, lowercase both the lead's normalized company name (strip `Inc/LLC/Corp/Ltd` suffixes) and the topic+summary text. If the company name (≥4 chars) does NOT appear anywhere in topic/summary, force `topic = null`. Drops wrong-person false positives (e.g. Aaron Boone the Yankees coach vs Aaron Boone the marketing exec). ~30% of grounded topics are wrong-person without this gate.

Writeback (same as before, plus the new filter result):
- `personalization_research` = full backend response (JSON string) — store `{message, sources_count, parsed, _hallucination_guard?}`
- `personalization_cost_cents` = 0 for Zeus, 1 for Perplexity (rounded up)
- `personalization_status` = `researched` if `topic != null` AFTER both guards, else `skipped`
- `lead_events` row: `event_type='status_changed'`, `event_data={phase:"list_optimize_research", status, has_topic, backend}`

**Parallelism:** Use `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=20)` for Zeus (single-tenant, no rate limit) or `xargs -P 4` for Perplexity (50 req/min ceiling). 20-way parallel on Zeus cuts a 4,500-lead run from ~38 hr serial to ~3 hr wall time.

**Subprocess avoidance:** Use direct HTTP to Turso (`POST /v2/pipeline`) for DB writes from the worker threads — `bash → subprocess → sql_escape` in 20 parallel workers fork-bombs the harness. The new script template handles this.

`--estimate-only` flag: prints the cost calc and exits without making any paid call. Use for dry-runs.

## Phase 4: Personalize (Claude in-session default, Anthropic API fallback)

For each lead with `personalization_status='researched'`, generate a 1-sentence opener using the lead row + research result + strategy messaging angle.

**Default: Claude in-session.** When running inside an active Claude Code session (Max plan), bypass the Anthropic API entirely:

```bash
# 1. Dump researched leads to a JSON prompt-pack
bash scripts/list-optimize/personalize.sh <campaign-name> --mode in-session --dump /tmp/personalize-todo.json

# 2. Claude (the active session) reads /tmp/personalize-todo.json, writes openers to /tmp/openers.json
#    Format: [{"id": <lead_id>, "opener": "<sentence>"}, ...]
#    Use "SKIP" as the opener value for any lead where the topic is bad-sentiment
#    (criminal/wrong-direction/wrong-person) — those fall back to the generic opener.

# 3. Import the openers back to Turso
bash scripts/list-optimize/personalize.sh <campaign-name> --mode in-session --import /tmp/openers.json
```

**Fallback: Anthropic API.** For headless runs (no active session) use Sonnet 4.6:

```bash
bash scripts/list-optimize/personalize.sh <campaign-name> --mode api [--limit N]
# Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY. Uses claude-sonnet-4-6. Skip Haiku — quality too low for cold-email openers.
```

**Constraints (validated before writeback in both modes; failures retry once, then mark `failed`):**
- 25 words maximum
- No banned tokens: `!`, `dear`, `hope this finds you well`, `I hope you're doing well`
- No em dash (`—`), en dash (`–`), or double hyphen (`--`)
- Must NOT contain merge tags inside (`{first_name}` is added by the copywriting template, not here)
- Must mention the lead's first name OR the specific topic from research (not both — keeps it natural)
- Sentiment check: reject openers riffing on criminal charges, recalls, layoffs, wrong-direction news (exec leaving). When in doubt mark `SKIP` and let fallback fire.

**Writeback:**
- `personalization_line` = the validated sentence (NULL when SKIP)
- `personalization_status` = `written` (success) | `skipped` (SKIP marker or filter-rejected) | `failed` (after retry)
- `lead_events` row: `event_type='status_changed'`, `event_data={phase:"list_optimize_personalize", status, line_preview, mode}`

See `references/personalization-prompt.md` for the prompt template.

## End-to-end orchestrator

```bash
bash scripts/list-optimize/run-pipeline.sh <campaign-name>
```

Flow:

1. **Phase 0 picker** (interactive, idempotent — see "Phase 0: Phase Picker" above). Selection persists in `.metadata.json`.
2. **Phases 1-2** (qualify + normalize) if selection includes them.
3. **Pauses, prompts user to run `/email-verification`** if any qualified leads are still unverified.
4. **Pre-flight variable validation** — runs `validate-campaign-vars.sh` before any Phase 3/4 DB writes (skipped for `qualify_only`). Hard-fails if the target Instantly/Email Bison campaign template can't carry our personalization payload.
5. **Phases 3-4** (Perplexity research + 1-sentence opener) if selection includes them.

Resume-aware: skips phases already complete (detects via `qualification_status` / `personalization_status` populated). Re-running with a stale selection in metadata replays only the unfinished phases per the saved selection.

Flags:
- `--reset-picker` — clear `list_optimize.selection` from metadata and re-prompt.
- `--skip-research` — legacy alias for `qualify_only` (preserved for backward compat).
- `--auto-yes` / `-y` — skip cost preflight prompt in Phase 3.
- `--resume` — pick up where you left off (default behavior; flag exists for clarity).

## Yield expectations (set these with the user before running)

For broad SMB B2B audiences (5-75 employee marketing agencies / IT services / consultancies / SaaS), the realistic yield is **2-5% of input leads end up with a personalized opener.** Most founders at this size don't have recent press coverage in the 90-day window.

Distribution from a real 4,562-lead run (Consulti Beta-Launch 2026-05-11):

| Stage | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| Started (verified + qualified) | 4,562 | 100% |
| Zeus returned 0 sources → killed by hallucination guard | ~3,500 | 77% |
| Zeus returned sources but no usable topic | ~500 | 11% |
| Zeus found topic, killed by company-name match filter (wrong-person) | 50 | 1% |
| Topic found, killed by sentiment filter (criminal/wrong-direction) | 9 | 0.2% |
| **Personalized opener written** | **110** | **2.4%** |
| Errors / timeouts | ~400 | 8% |

The remaining 95%+ get the generic spintax opener via the `{personalization|fallback}` token in E1. **This is the expected outcome, not a bug.** If a user expects 30%+ personalization, calibrate that expectation BEFORE running — the volume gain from going paid (Perplexity sonar) vs free (Zeus search) is marginal because the underlying problem is lack of press coverage, not search quality.

## Copywriting integration

After `list-optimize` finishes, `cold-email-copywriting` MAY include an optional `{personalization}` token in the **first sentence of E1 only**. The token is required to be wrapped in spintax with a generic fallback so leads with no `personalization_line` still get a natural-sounding opener:

```
{personalization|Hey {FIRST_NAME} – came across <company_name_normalized> and figured I'd reach out.}
```

The deploy step (Email Bison / Instantly) substitutes the per-lead value at upload time. If `personalization_line IS NULL` for a given lead, the spintax fallback fires.

E2-E4 are NOT personalized — they reuse generic openers per the standard 4-email structure.

## Database fields written

This skill is the only writer of these `leads` columns:

| Column | Phase | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `qualification_status` | 1 | `qualified` / `disqualified` |
| `qualification_reason` | 1 | LLM text |
| `qualification_score` | 1 | 0-100 |
| `company_name_original` | 2 | preserved raw |
| `company_name_normalized` | 2 | canonical form |
| `personalization_research` | 3 | Perplexity JSON |
| `personalization_cost_cents` | 3 | per-lead cost |
| `personalization_status` | 3, 4 | `researched` / `written` / `failed` / `skipped` |
| `personalization_line` | 4 | 1-sentence opener |

Existing columns this skill READS: `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `job_title`, `company_name`, `company_domain`, `industry`, `company_size`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `pipeline_status`, `do_not_contact`, `linkedin_url`.

Existing column this skill WRITES: `do_not_contact` (set to `1` for disqualified leads in Phase 1).

## Reports

Use `lead-report.sh` to inspect cleaning results:
```bash
bash scripts/lead-report.sh qualification    # distribution by status
bash scripts/lead-report.sh personalization  # distribution + total Perplexity spend
bash scripts/lead-report.sh dupes            # near-duplicate company groups
```

(These report flags are added by the list-optimize install — they read directly from the new columns.)

## Safety rules

- **NEVER** delete leads. Disqualified = mark + keep (`qualification_status='disqualified'`, `do_not_contact=1`).
- **NEVER** auto-merge company-name duplicates. Report only.
- **ALWAYS** confirm cost preflight before any Phase 3 paid run. Default to abort.
- **ALWAYS** write a `lead_events` row when changing `qualification_status` or `personalization_status`.
- Phase 3 is skipped automatically for leads with `pipeline_status != 'verified'` — no Perplexity spend on bounces.
