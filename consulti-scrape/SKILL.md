# Consulti Lead Scraping

## Step 0 — Prerequisites

This is a prompt-only skill (no scripts of its own — it teaches Claude how to call the Consulti REST API and pipe results into `lead-tracking-db`'s `import-leads.sh`). Verify these before invoking:

| Requirement | Check | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| `curl`, `jq` | `command -v curl jq` | preinstalled |
| `CONSULTI_API_KEY` | `[ -n "$CONSULTI_API_KEY" ]` | <https://app.consulti.ai> → Settings → Integrations → generate key (starts with `capi_`) |
| `lead-tracking-db` skill installed | `[ -x ~/.claude/skills/lead-tracking-db/scripts/import-leads.sh ]` | install via the marketplace before running this skill — its `import-leads.sh` is what ingests Consulti's JSON into the Turso `leads` table |

If `CONSULTI_API_KEY` is missing, stop. If `lead-tracking-db` isn't installed, install it first (this skill's pipeline pipes into `lead-tracking-db/scripts/import-leads.sh`) — do NOT proceed without it.

Pulls leads from Consulti.ai's three databases and tracks each pull in a named Consulti audience list so repeat scrapes never return the same lead twice.

## Skill chain position

`consulti-scrape` → `/email-verification` (Consulti) → `/cold-email-campaign-deploy`.

Native Consulti JSON lands in the workspace. Turso ingest via `scripts/import-leads.sh` keeps the `leads` table authoritative so downstream skills read one source of truth.

## API reference

Base URL: `https://app.consulti.ai/api/v1` · Auth: `Authorization: Bearer $CONSULTI_API_KEY`

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST | `/leads/search` | 500M+ B2B DB — **supports `excludeListId`** |
| POST | `/local-leads/search` | Google Maps businesses (no native exclusion) |
| POST | `/creator-leads/search` | Podcasts / YouTube (no native exclusion) |
| GET  | `/lists` | List saved audience lists |
| POST | `/lists` | Create audience list |
| POST | `/lists/{listId}/add-leads` | Add members by `emails[]` or `businessIds[]` (upsert-safe) |
| POST | `/verify` | Email verification — primary method, used by `/email-verification` |
| POST | `/leads/enrich` | Enrich by email — 1 credit on match, free on 404 |
| POST | `/leads/find-by-linkedin` | Enrich by LinkedIn URL — 1 credit on match, free on 404 |
| POST | `/leads/find-by-name` | Find email by name + domain — 1 credit on match, free on 404 |
| GET  | `/meta/{filter}` | Canonical enum values (no auth, free, 1h edge cache) |
| GET  | `/meta/_all` | Snapshot of every filter at once |

`/meta` filters: `industries`, `countries`, `states`, `email-statuses`, `local-states`, `creator-podcast-categories`, `creator-youtube-niches`, `creator-languages`, `creator-countries`. Hit these instead of hardcoding when a campaign returns suspiciously zero results — the canonical values change.

## Setup

1. app.consulti.ai → Settings → Integrations → generate key
2. Append to `.env`: `CONSULTI_API_KEY=capi_...` (keys start with `capi_`)
3. Done. No MCP install, no restart.

Optional: `npx consulti-mcp` exposes the same endpoints as MCP tools — this skill uses direct curl to match repo convention.

## Audience list naming

One list per distinct ICP. Format: `lgj-scraped-{audience-slug}`:
- `lgj-scraped-us-saas-vp-marketing`
- `lgj-scraped-fl-marketing-agencies`
- `lgj-scraped-business-podcasts`

Re-scraping the same audience reuses the list. A new audience creates a new list. Internal ops reference the list UUID returned by `GET /lists` / `POST /lists`.

## Response shape (all searches)

```json
{
  "leads": [
    { "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe", "email": "john@acme.com",
      "job_title": "CEO", "company_name": "Acme Inc", "company_domain": "acme.com",
      "linkedin_url": "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe", "city": "San Francisco",
      "state": "California", "country": "United States", "employees": 150,
      "industry": "Computer Software", "email_status": "good",
      "verified_at": "2026-04-12T00:00:00Z" }
  ],
  "total": 1247, "page": 1, "size": 25
}
```

API quirk: `/leads/search` returns the count as `employees` (number); the lookup endpoints (`/leads/find-by-linkedin`, `/leads/find-by-name`, `/leads/enrich`) return it as `employee_count`. The Turso import jq below already coerces `.employees` → `company_size`. If you switch to a lookup endpoint, map `.data.employee_count` instead.

## B2B workflow (primary)

### 1. Resolve or create the audience list

```bash
source .env
AUDIENCE="lgj-scraped-us-saas-vp-marketing"

LIST_ID=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONSULTI_API_KEY" \
  "https://app.consulti.ai/api/v1/lists" \
  | jq -r --arg n "$AUDIENCE" '.lists[] | select(.name == $n) | .id')

if [ -z "$LIST_ID" ]; then
  # POST /lists wraps the response in {"list": {...}} — extract .list.id
  LIST_ID=$(curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONSULTI_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"name\":\"$AUDIENCE\"}" \
    "https://app.consulti.ai/api/v1/lists" | jq -r '.list.id')
fi
echo "List: $LIST_ID"
```

### 2. Paginate `/leads/search` with native exclusion

```bash
RUN_DIR=".claude/skills/consulti-scrape-workspace/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR"
PAGE=1
TARGET=500   # hard cap — protect credits

> "$RUN_DIR/pages.jsonl"
while :; do
  RESP=$(curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONSULTI_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{
      \"titles\":[\"VP Marketing\",\"Head of Marketing\"],
      \"industries\":[\"Computer Software\"],
      \"countries\":[\"United States\"],
      \"empMin\":50,\"empMax\":500,
      \"emailStatus\":\"good\",
      \"excludeListId\":\"$LIST_ID\",
      \"page\":$PAGE,\"size\":100
    }" \
    "https://app.consulti.ai/api/v1/leads/search")
  echo "$RESP" >> "$RUN_DIR/pages.jsonl"
  COUNT=$(echo "$RESP" | jq '.leads | length')
  TOTAL=$(echo "$RESP" | jq '.total')
  PULLED=$(jq -s 'map(.leads | length) | add' "$RUN_DIR/pages.jsonl")
  (( COUNT == 0 )) && break
  (( PAGE * 100 >= TOTAL )) && break
  (( PULLED >= TARGET )) && break
  (( PAGE++ ))
done

jq -s '{leads: (map(.leads[]) | unique_by(.email)), total: (map(.total) | max)}' \
  "$RUN_DIR/pages.jsonl" > "$RUN_DIR/leads.json"
```

### 3. Add emails to the audience list

Batches of ≤ 1000. `add-leads` is upsert-safe so retry on transient failures is cheap.

```bash
EMAILS=$(jq '[.leads[].email | select(. != null)]' "$RUN_DIR/leads.json")
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONSULTI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"emails\":$EMAILS}" \
  "https://app.consulti.ai/api/v1/lists/$LIST_ID/add-leads"
```

### 4. Import to Turso

The import script's `leads-finder` mapper matches nearly all Consulti fields — a small `jq` rename handles `linkedin_url` → `linkedin` and coerces `employees` to a string for `company_size`.

```bash
jq '[.leads[] | {
  first_name, last_name, email, job_title,
  company_name, company_domain, industry,
  company_size: (.employees // empty | tostring),
  city, state, country,
  linkedin: .linkedin_url
}]' "$RUN_DIR/leads.json" \
  | ./scripts/import-leads.sh - consulti
```

This writes `source_actor='consulti'` on every lead and creates one `scrape_jobs` row with `actor_name='consulti'`.

### 5. Tell the user to run `/email-verification` next

Report: `{run_dir, list_id, scraped, unique_emails, imported}`.

## Local workflow (Google Maps)

No native exclusion. Dedup client-side via `leads.google_place_id` in Turso.

```bash
# Pre-fetch known place IDs
EXCLUDES=$(source ./scripts/db-query.sh && db_query \
  "SELECT google_place_id FROM leads WHERE source_actor='consulti' AND google_place_id IS NOT NULL" \
  | jq -R . | jq -s .)

# Page → filter → save
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONSULTI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"states":["FL"],"keywords":["marketing agency"],"hasEmail":true,"page":1,"size":100}' \
  "https://app.consulti.ai/api/v1/local-leads/search" \
  | jq --argjson ex "$EXCLUDES" \
      '.leads |= map(select((.google_place_id // .place_id) as $g | ($ex | index($g)) | not))' \
  > "$RUN_DIR/page-1.json"

# Add businessIds (NOT emails) to the audience list
BIDS=$(jq '[.leads[].id | select(. != null)]' "$RUN_DIR/page-1.json")
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONSULTI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"businessIds\":$BIDS}" \
  "https://app.consulti.ai/api/v1/lists/$LIST_ID/add-leads"
```

Then `jq` the pages into `leads.json` and import with actor `consulti` as in step 4.

## Creator workflow (podcasts / YouTube)

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONSULTI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source":"podcast","categories":["Business"],"hasEmail":true,"page":1,"size":100}' \
  "https://app.consulti.ai/api/v1/creator-leads/search"
```

Response uses `"creators"` key (not `"leads"`):
```json
{
  "creators": [
    {"id":"...", "name":"...", "email":"...", "source":"podcast", "category":"Business",
     "website":"https://...", "episodes":100, "language":"en"}
  ],
  "total": 2832, "page": 1, "size": 100
}
```

Dedup client-side against `leads.email` where `source_actor='consulti'`. Add members via `{emails}`.

## Input schemas

### `/leads/search` (B2B)
| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `q` | string | Free-text over name/title/company/industry. Use this for fuzzy intent (`"web design"`, `"agency"`); `industries[]` is exact-match. |
| `titles` | string[] | e.g. `["CEO","Founder","VP Marketing"]` |
| `industries` | string[] | **Exact-match, case-sensitive** against the 145-value canonical list — see [Canonical filter values](#canonical-filter-values) below. Wrong case or off-list strings silently return zero. |
| `countries` | string[] | Full country names (`"United States"`, not `"US"`). Quirk: list also accepts US state names (`"Florida"`, `"California"`). |
| `states` | string[] | Full state/region names — 877 canonical values, case-sensitive. |
| `cities` | string[] | |
| `company` | string | Company name search |
| `empMin` / `empMax` | number | Employee count bounds |
| `emailStatus` | enum | One of `bad`, `good`, `invalid`, `risky`, `unknown`, `valid`. Use `good` for cold-email-grade leads. **`"verified"` is not canonical and silently returns 0** — `"all"` is also not in the enum, omit the field instead of passing `"all"`. |
| `excludeListId` | string (UUID) | **Native exclusion — B2B only** |
| `page` / `size` | number | 1-indexed · max size 100 |

### `/local-leads/search`
`q`, `name`, `keywords[]`, `states[]` (**2-letter codes only — US states + Canadian provinces, 58 canonical values**; full names will not match), `cities[]`, `zips[]`, `ratingMin/Max`, `reviewsMin/Max`, `hasEmail`, `hasPhone`, `hasWeb`, `page`, `size`.

### `/creator-leads/search`
`source: "youtube" | "podcast"` (**required**), `q`, `hasEmail`, `categories[]` (e.g. `["Business"]`), `niches[]`, `country`, `language`, `minSubscribers` / `maxSubscribers`, `minEpisodes`, `page`, `size`.

**Note:** Response uses `creators` key (array of creator objects with name, email, website, category, episodes, language, source fields).

## Canonical filter values

`industries[]`, `countries[]`, `states[]`, `emailStatus`, and the creator filters are **case-sensitive exact-match** against canonical lists. Off-list strings, lowercase variants, and `&` ↔ `and` ↔ `or` ↔ `/` swaps silently return zero. For fuzzy intent, use the `q` field.

**Live source of truth:** `GET /api/v1/meta/{filter}` (no auth, free, 1h edge cache). Hit this when a filter starts returning zero — the canonical list shifts.

```bash
curl -s "https://app.consulti.ai/api/v1/meta/industries" | jq -r '.values[]'
curl -s "https://app.consulti.ai/api/v1/meta/_all" | jq '.filters | keys'
```

| Filter | Slug | Count | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| B2B industries | `industries` | 145 | Apollo `industry_std`. Full list below. |
| B2B countries | `countries` | 192 | Full names (`United States`). **Quirk**: list mixes country names with US state names (`Arizona`, `California`, `Florida`, `Texas`, …) — `countries[]` accepts US-state-level granularity. |
| B2B states | `states` | 877 | Case-sensitive global subdivisions (`California`, `Bavaria`, `Catalonia`, `County Dublin`, …). |
| B2B email statuses | `email-statuses` | 6 | `bad, good, invalid, risky, unknown, valid`. Use `good` for cold-email-grade leads. **`"verified"` is NOT canonical and silently returns 0.** |
| Local states | `local-states` | 58 | 2-letter codes only — US states **plus** Canadian provinces (`AB, BC, NB, NS, ON, QC, SK`). Full names will not match. |
| Podcast categories | `creator-podcast-categories` | 243 | Both Title Case and lowercase variants exist (`Business`, `business`). |
| YouTube niches | `creator-youtube-niches` | 361 | Mostly lowercase tokens (`saas`, `ecommerce`, `fitness`). |
| Creator languages | `creator-languages` | 31 | Mix of `en`, `en-US`, `English`, `eng` — try multiple if zero results. |
| Creator countries | `creator-countries` | 66 | Mix of 2-letter codes (`US`, `GB`) and full names (`United States`, `Germany`). |

**Watch-outs that bite:**
- `Health, Wellness & Fitness`, `Leisure, Travel & Tourism`, and `Glass, Ceramics & Concrete` contain commas — pass as single array items, don't split.
- `Mechanical or Industrial Engineering` uses **`or`**, not `&` (the only entry where `or` is correct).
- `Electrical/Electronic Manufacturing`, `Airlines/Aviation`, `Outsourcing/Offshoring`, `Package/Freight Delivery`, `Primary/Secondary Education`, `Transportation/Trucking/Railroad` use slashes — no spaces around the `/`.
- `Nonprofit Organization Management` is one word, no hyphen.
- Outdated strings that **no longer match**: `Aerospace & Defense`, `Manufacturing`, `Newspapers`, `Supermarkets`, `Mechanical & Industrial Engineering`, `Electrical & Electronic Manufacturing`, `Non-Profit Organization Management`. If you see these in old runbooks, replace before re-running.
- Common cold-email targets: `Marketing & Advertising`, `Internet`, `Computer Software`, `Information Technology & Services`, `Online Media`, `Public Relations & Communications`, `Management Consulting`, `Staffing & Recruiting`, `Professional Training & Coaching`.

## Lookup workflow (single-record enrichment)

Three lookup endpoints — each costs **1 credit on match, free on 404**. Use to enrich an existing list (Apify LinkedIn URLs, name+domain CSVs, or a known email needing more fields) before campaign launch. The skill chain still runs `/email-verification` afterward, since lookup `email_status` may be stale.

```bash
# By LinkedIn URL — best for Apify harvestapi profile dumps
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONSULTI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"linkedin_url":"https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe"}' \
  "https://app.consulti.ai/api/v1/leads/find-by-linkedin"

# By name + domain — best for compass/google-places + xmiso owner-name dumps
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONSULTI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Doe","domain":"acme.com"}' \
  "https://app.consulti.ai/api/v1/leads/find-by-name"

# Enrich by email — fills missing first_name/job_title/company_domain on a known email
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONSULTI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"john@acme.com"}' \
  "https://app.consulti.ai/api/v1/leads/enrich"
```

Response (all three): `{ "success": true, "data": { email, first_name, last_name, job_title, company_name, company_domain, industry, linkedin_url, city, state, country, employee_count, email_status, verified_at }, "credits_used": 1 }`. On 404: `{ "error": "..." }` and `credits_used: 0`.

When ingesting lookup results into the same Turso pipeline, swap `.employees` for `.data.employee_count` in the step-4 jq mapper:

```bash
jq '[.data | { first_name, last_name, email, job_title,
  company_name, company_domain, industry,
  company_size: (.employee_count // empty | tostring),
  city, state, country, linkedin: .linkedin_url }]' lookup-results.json \
  | ./scripts/import-leads.sh - consulti
```

## Pagination & credit safety

- Use `size: 100` always (max)
- Stop conditions: empty page, `page * size >= total`, or `pulled >= target_count`
- **`total: 10001` is a server-side cap** — when the true match count exceeds 10k the API returns `10001` literally. Do not trust it as a real count above 10k; rely on `pulled >= target_count` to stop.
- Credits deduct on **result view** (search cached for 30s server-side — repeat queries in-window are free)
- Always hard-cap every run with a `target_count` ceiling

## Gotchas

- **`emailStatus` canonical values: `bad, good, invalid, risky, unknown, valid`** — `"verified"` and `"all"` are NOT in the enum and silently return 0. Omit the field instead of passing `"all"`. See `GET /meta/email-statuses` for the live list.
- **`industries[]` is exact-match against the 145-value canonical list** — wrong case, off-list strings, or stale names like `Aerospace & Defense`/`Manufacturing`/`Newspapers`/`Supermarkets`/`Mechanical & Industrial Engineering`/`Non-Profit Organization Management` return zero. Use `q` for fuzzy intent, or `GET /meta/industries` to refresh.
- **`POST /lists` wraps the response in `{"list": {...}}`** — extract `.list.id`, not `.id`. `GET /lists` uses `.lists[].id` (plural). Don't conflate them
- **`total: 10001` is a server-side cap, not a true count** — at >10k matches the API returns the literal `10001`. Trust `pulled >= target_count` to stop, not `total`
- **`excludeListId` is B2B-only** — local + creator dedup happens client-side against Turso
- **Email masking on free tier** — do a `size: 1` smoke test first to confirm your API key returns full emails
- **`add-leads` upsert-safe** via `UNIQUE(list_id, email)` / `(list_id, business_id)` — resending batches is harmless
- **Pick the right ID field**: B2B + creators use `{emails}`, local uses `{businessIds}`
- **Field rename**: Consulti returns `linkedin_url`; the import script's mapper reads `linkedin` — the step-4 `jq` transform handles it
- **`employees` vs `company_size`**: Consulti's `employees` is a number; Turso `leads.company_size` is text — `jq | tostring` coerces

## Safety rules

- **Always** pass an audience list name — unnamed runs are not reproducible
- **Always** cap with `target_count` — runaway paginators drain credits fast
- **Always** smoke-test new `industries[]` strings with a `size:1` query first — wrong casing returns zero silently
- **Never** add scraped leads to a campaign without `/email-verification` — even `emailStatus: "good"` entries bounce occasionally
- **Never** skip `scripts/import-leads.sh` — Turso is how the chain dedups across skills
